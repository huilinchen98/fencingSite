      <h3>Simple Attacks</h3>

      <p>Simple attacks are just that: simple, fast, easy. They rely on surprise to hit, because if there's no surprise, then the defender can defend against simple attacks with simple defense.</p>

      <p> By "surprise," we mean change in tempo. If a fencer's attack is all fast, it won't be surprising; if the attack is all slow, it won't be surprising. If it's fast then slow, or slow then fast, it will surprise the opponent.</p>

      <p> Definitionally, "simple" attacks are direct attacks. For our purposes, we include all one- and two-part attacks that aren't marching attacks.</p>

    <h2 id="carry">Carry through the attack</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a99znL0obbA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/direct_attack_nice.gif"></center>
    <p>In this action, Fencer Right comes off the <i>on guard </i>line with an advance and a lunge -- and scores! This action is from the 2003 World Championships, and both competitors can do much, much more complicated fencing. But a straight attack was all that was needed, and the straight attack works.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, the simple attacks land for no good reason. When simple attacks seem unsafe, irrational, and ill-advised, this is one of the best times to use them -- the opponent isn't expecting it.</p>
    <p>Then again, simple attacks are usually easy to defend against. They start too quickly to be obscured  with preparations, they finish too quickly to benefit from deceptions. With a simple attack, what the defender sees is what the defender getsâ€¦ which is the way defenders like it.</p>
    <p>If you're going to attack simple, make it surprising and <i>make it land</i>. Accelerate faster than the opponent can move, and hit through the parry. The main aspect of this action is that fencer right attacked with utter conviction and commitment. He believed in the attack, and carried it through. He hit through the opponent's parry.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="power">Power attack</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/SNySe1tuazw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/att_simpleshortfast.gif"></center>
    <p>Sometimes the launching of the attack isn't surprising, but rather the power or degree to which the attack is prosecuted. <i>Intensity</i>.</p>
    <p> This attack worked because something that seemed manageable to the defender suddenly became too much to handle. The defender didn't understand her danger until too late.</p>
    <br>
      
    <h2 id="sfs">Simple, fast, short are safe</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/DdZlpkEqYJw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/long_lunge_good.gif"></center>
    <p> The notion of a "safe" attack might sound strange at first - can there really be anything safe about any action in fencing? Not really.</p>
    <p>  But with foil at least, the fencer with priority is very safe from being scored against (assuming they finish with a hit). As long as you're attacking, and certain things don't happen (like a parry), you're safe. The opponent must block the attack, or wait for it to otherwise finish, before they can create a Right of Way threat against you. </p>
    <p> So a short, fast and simple attack is quite safe; all you have to do is turn on a light (any light). Only if the attack is slow, compound, or has preparations do you have to worry about the integrity of the attack, because then, the opponent has an opportunity to try to mess it up. With a short direct simple attack, there's simply no time.</p>
    <br>  

    <h2 id="slow">Long and slower with distance</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/R7EaZwuGXWw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/long_lunge_good.gif"></center>

    <p>This video clip is a nice illustration of why fencers lunge. </p>
    <p> Let's face it: Lunging is exhausting, what with the pushing, the landing, the flexing thigh muscles and the dragging shoes. A fencer in a lunge is also uniquely at risk, since they have no mobility and are stuck with their feet far apart.</p>
    <p> Despite how uneconomical the lunge is, it's worth it. With a lunge at the right time, the risk is minimized, and the energy used is much lower than a dozen corps-a-corps actions to achieve the same thing (a point).</p>
    <p> Fencer right lunges, hits, and is completely safe. Her opponent wanted to get away, but couldn't move fast enough. When she saw she couldn't get enough distance, she tried to parry riposte - but an en garde fencer's reach is nothing like a lunging fencer's reach. This is why fencers invented the lunge in the first place.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="tempo">Tempo to launch attack</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-paXqiE3N90?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/tempo_to_hit.gif"></center>

    <p>After some jockeying and distance work, fencer right feels it's time to attack. <i>Uh-oh!</i> Fencer left has already felt the timing, and launched her attack a tempo ahead.</p>
    <p>Even the simplest and most direct actions can be trumped this way, by the sense of time.</p>
    <p>Note how fencer left added an unneccessary step before her final lunge. Fencer right was doubtless trained to perceive this accident as a launch-time. If you're in lunge distance, and the opponent makes a preparatory action, you can start your attack and own priority. However, there was no doubt in the director's mind, attack from left.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="speed">Change in speed</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/C28sUSDR6Y4?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/tempo_to_hit.gif"></center>

    <p>The director calls "Fence!" and both fencers step forward. One fencer has already tied himself into the action, and the other hasn't. One is intense and direct, the other isn't. Both fencers are taking the action seriously, but one is much more serious than the other.</p>
    <p>When the fencers get within hitting distance, fencer left makes a compound attack - an inside-to-outside feint attack with a step lunge. According to the tactical wheel, the way to defeat a feint attack is to attack direct (it's the action where the wheel rolls back to the beginning). And that's what fencer right does. He darts forward, achieving such a complete surprise that fencer left can't even put a light on.</p>
    <p>Change in speed <i>is</i> tempo, it's the essence of surprise. Fencer right's attack is much faster than his prior advances. By advancing at a normal speed, he gave no indication to his opponent of what was to come. Fencer left has no premonition of danger, so his intensity doesn't elevate, and his hand never goes into the fast reflexive mode that hard-pressed fencers use to defend themselves.</p>
    <p>If fencer right had tipped off his opponent that this was a "serious" action, his simple attack might not have worked. A tense arm, jerky footwork, fast advances - any of these would have put fencer left into a defensive frame of mind. But fencer right <i>didn't</i> tip off his opponent; he went slow-fast and earned a decisive touch.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="open">Opening the opponent for delivery</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/XeswA-YLZeg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Open_opponent.gif"></center>

    <p>This action appears to feature a byzantine series of feints on the part of the near fencer. While it looks complicated and difficult, we're only seeing what the opponent is seeing.</p>
    <p>Follow the nearer fencer's hand (not his blade) to see how simple his action really is. He is making a circular scoop motion, followed by a fast extension. Done in front of a mirror, it would seem unexceptional. What makes it work so effectively is that his opponent so completely buys into it. The far fencer, expecting a more definitive, direct action, is left searching for the blade, and never finds it until it's too late. He probably wishes he'd pulled distance.</p>
    <p>Also - sometimes an opponent will forget to move while they're trying to find parries. This is called rooting to the ground, and it happens because the opponent's mind has been so suddenly engaged with a blade problem that they forget the distance problem. In this action, fencer right, who was moving quite easily before the attack, froze on the spot and tried to find the parry. Experiment with different opponents, and find the ones which root when you give them a few disengages.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="prep">Attack in preparation</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/pEwOTmnaSxM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/attack_preparation.gif"></center>

    <p>Fencer left starts an action, fencer right attacks into it.</p>
    <p>Attacks into preparation are reactive, because they are launched when the opponent is already doing something threatening. Many fencing newcomers (and not so newcomers) confuse attacks into preparation with counter-attacks, because they can look and feel the same, and they accomplish the same things.</p>
    <p>A <i>counter-attack</i> is an attack on an attack, and it gets no Right of Way because the attack already has priority. An <i>attack into preparation</i> is an attack on something that might become an attack but isn't yet; it does get Right of Way, because it's the only attack in the action.</p>
    <p>Still, attacks into preparation have a "gotcha" feel like successful counter-attacks. They rely on the opponent to bring their target to your tip, so all you have to worry about is predicting the right time to attack. To be good at predicting, you must find ways that your opponent is predictable.</p>
    <p>Many fencers always prepare their attacks the same way: They might make a galloping advance, or they might swish the blade, or they might only shift their weight forward. Keep an eye out for these tell-tale signs, and see what an attack at those moments (even a false attack) can do.</p>
    <p>If your opponent isn't preparing much, then that means they're probably content to hit you with simple direct attacks. What's the story with that!? Start moving! When you use distance to your advantage, the opponent will have to work harder to hit you. They can't just lunge and finish the action. To get you in distance for their attacks, they'll have to move you back and forth, distract you with the blade, and do a few feints - and these are all preparations.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="counter">Counter-attack against simple attacks</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/sAOTCl3AYhI?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Counter_with_esquive.gif"></center>
    <p>There are few things to do against simple attacks, apart from taking the expected parry riposte. This is what makes <i>esquives</i> so useful.</p>
    <p>  In this action, fencer right counters into the attack, but further complicates her opponent's point control by displacing her target. Fencer left, committing to her attack early, couldn't change targets and hit the back.</p>
    <p>  Fencer right's timing is either very precise or very lucky. <i>Or</i> it's habitual - in which case you can invite the counter and finish on the back.</p>
    <br>  
    

    <h2 id="tall">Against tall opponents</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PLYJugXLARY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Against_tall_opp.gif"></center>

    <p>Against people with longer reach, you have to really, really make a feeling of surprise.</p>
    <p>  Here, fencer left launches a good surprise attack. It doesn't look extremely surprising to us, but note how the taller opponent is tricked into bringing her body into range - the opponent thought she had a beat attack. In reality, fencer left derobed around it and ended in high line target.</p>
    <br> 


    <h2 id="hesitation">Hesitation tempo attack</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/KKqeK-2ZQww?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Hesitation_tempo_att.gif"></center>
    <p>In modern fencing, national styles are hard to pinpoint. This, however, is a wonderful example of a German hesitation attack from the late 80's, still used today.</p>
    <p>  Some of its effectiveness is due to its tempo: During the defender's best parrying time, the attacker's blade is nowhere to be found because it's pulled back to the hip. The defender is left swishing at the air with their blade. The point lands <i>after</i> the parry.</p>
    <p>  This attack also works because of the upwards angle of approach of the tip. By starting in the low-line and traveling up to the high-line, the attacker nullifies low-line parries and gets his tip closer to the target before a high-line parry would intersect the blade. A low-line parry that scoops the blade to high-line (such as a flying 7) would still allow the tip to get close to target.</p>
    <p>  These attacks are fun to do, and easy to hit with, but be careful - they're addictive! If you build all your attacks around this rhythm, you'll be impotent against the first fencer who knows about hesitation parries.</p>
    <p>  <i>Defending against</i>: Unless you're surprised, you can attack into preparation with a fast direct extension, and run away before the opponent's tip comes forward. This sort of attack brings the attacker's target close, while their arm is pulling back.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="late">Late-arriving hand attack</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FARNyxwSbA0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/The_late_arriving_att.gif"></center>
    <p>In this action, fencer right completes her lunge, but delays her extension. By doing this, she is sending mixed information to her opponent. </p>
    <p> Fencer left reads the completion of the lunge as the actual delivery of the attack, and attempts to find the parry based on her opponent's footwork. She doesn't find the parry - she swings at the air - because the attack has been withheld. </p>
    <p> For many fencers who use this technique without thinking, this could be called a bad habit. The moment it gets predictable, it's a severe liability. Used here, and at this moment, it's a very sophisticated and effective way of disjoining hand tempo and foot tempo.</p>
    <br>  


    <h2 id="verylate">Very, very late arriving attack</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/F3QZM4bcRHw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Very_late_arr_att.gif"></center>
    <p>Just to mix things up, you can play with the signals you're giving to your opponent. </p>
    <p> Here, fencer left showed a concluded attack to her opponent - the lunge was launched, the lunge landed. Her opponent took the parry at the most reliable time - except the attack was still going forward! The opponent took another few parries, but they were all guesswork. </p>
    <p> Of course, this approach is dangerous when the opponent is not ready to be fooled.</p>
    <p>Also note - when the extension finally comes from the left, it's very fast. When an opponent is windmilling with parries, the fast decisive extension can get through them.</p>
    <br>  


    <h2 id="invite">Invite simple attacks</h2> 
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/FLdHesKmn6o?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>  -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/Decision_point_forcing.gif"></center>
    <p>Fencer right made herself a juicy target, preparing forward against a ready opponent. We've all surfed this wave before. Fencer left sees the opening, and launches into it.</p>
    <p>  But fencer right has more tricks up her sleeve. She's noticed how fencer left isn't <i>really</i> ready - her tip is low, she's a bit far away, and based on prior actions she leans forward when extending. (The leaning is what does it, it removes her options for a counter-action.)</p>
    <p>  Fencer right is really inviting her opponent. Having drawn a quickly thrown-together and badly constructed attack from her opponent, she picks up an easy parry riposte.</p>
    <p>This action is also under Decision Point marching - marches are invitations.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="closeout">Counter with close-out</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/ebNDcNqUFRw?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/stophit_closeout.gif"></center>
    <p>This action might also be called attack from left, parry riposte, touch right. Or, it could be attack from left, counter attack. For our needs, we'll call it attack from right.</p>
    <p>Close-outs are hybrid actions that go against the normal flow of bladework. Usually, a blade is either defending or attacking. Very occasionally, it can do both.</p>
    <p>In this action, fencer right attacks (or counter-attacks), while at the same time forcing the opponent's blade away from his target. It's not quite a prise de fer, which is (by definition) a preparation of attack, but it's almost the same thing. It would have been one if the action hadn't finished so quickly, but it did, so it gets its own name: the close-out.</p>
    <p>The close-out works best like any bind, when the strong part of your blade is against the weak part of the opponent's blade. When the opponent's blade is extended in line, as for an attack, it offers enough resistance so that you can catch it near your bell guard and slide along the blade back towards the opponent's target. Hence that short, metallic "slurp" sound.</p>
    <br>


    <h2 id="reallysimple">Simple attacks are simple</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/YsTN9o6q5do?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/make_it_look_easy1.gif"></center>
    <p>Every now and then, simple attacks are <i>really simple.</i> After a fencer has practiced committed attacks and hesitation attacks, fast and slow attacks, safe and risky attacksâ€¦ after they've run the gamut, and practiced everything, they should remind themselves that attacks are about hitting the opponent. It is very easy to get caught up in the attack itself, and to see a good attack as the goal.</p>

    <p>It's not the kitchen, it's the food.</p> <!-- wat -->
    <p>It's not the music, it's the mood.</p> <!-- I didn't write this -->

    <p>For attacks, the real goal is putting the point on the opponent. If you don't have to pop a tendon, or even break a sweat while doing it, so be it.</p>

    <p>In this action, fencer left advances towards his opponent. He doesn't look like he's in close distance, due in part to his raised hand. When he extends, he extends very close to his opponent's blade. Note the blade-sound as his opponent actually finds the parry and begins to move the tip away from his target. But it's too late - the distance is too close, and fencer left's tip is traveling forward faster than the parry is pushing it sideways. The result is a neat little touch, with very little sweat.
    </p>
    <p>This is just one touch, but at the right time, a simple attack like this can cause a spike in the defender's mental activity. He may think anything from, <i>I'm a fool!</i> to <i>What was I thinking?</i> to even, <i>Gee that guy is good!</i> While they're trying to pinpoint their feelings about what happened, the attacker gets a quiet glow of pride. A secondary goal, then, is to make everything you do look easy: It makes your opponent afraid, or at least a little morbid about their chances against you.</p>
    <br>

    <h2 id="beatgo">Beat-and-go simple attack</h2>
    <!-- <center><iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VvdGjdkf9So?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center> -->
    <center><img src="../imgs/gifs/simple_attack_gallop.gif"></center>
    <p>Fencer left gallops forward, gets into distance and makes a beat attack. <i>So what?</i></p>

    <p>There are similar looking attacks under Marching attacks, but this one has a different philosophical foundation. Generally speaking, marches are to get the opponent to make the wrong reaction. Simple attacks are to deprive the opponent of the <i>chance</i> to react. In Short march for longer lunge, for example, fencer left beats the blade, pauses for her opponent to make an early parry, and then hits on the other side. In <i>this</i> action, fencer left beats with the intent to hit <i>before</i> the opponent can do anything at all.
    </p>
    <p>This attack is also interesting because as normal as it seems simple beat attacks are not very common in low- and intermediate-level fencing. Study fencers at the lower level, and you'll see many beats that have no follow-up extensions at all, or beats followed by a pullback of the hand (there's some of that in this action). When extensions happen, they are late, or slow, or ambiguous about target, as if the fencer didn't have the target already selected prior to the beat.</p>
    <p>Crummy beat-attacks happen for many reasons. The fencer might be beating, and then looking to see what target was opened. The fencer's beat might have been made with the whole arm (rather than just a spank of the blade originating from the wrist), and so it takes a while to bring the point back around to target. Or the fencer might simply have no confidence in the felicity of a beat-and-go, becauseâ€¦ wellâ€¦ it's so simple, how could it work?

    <p>Eventually, every newcomer figures out that fencing isn't about complex actions, but rather simple actions. The simple actions score the points, and few things are simpler than a beat attack. Sure, fencing is complex, but the complexity is built out of simple things, like a house is built out of bricks.</p>
