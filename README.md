Cal Fencing website overhaul.

Everything is just standard twitter bootstrap. CSS for jumbotron has been modified to use a photo for the background. In case the youtube videos in the guide are down, there is a zip file with the original clips. Post announcments using wordpress, make slideshows using flickr.
